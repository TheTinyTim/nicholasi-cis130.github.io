							<h3>About the Toys</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							The toys at T3 are really fun. Kids from all walks of life can find something here to enjoy.
							We have puzzles, stuffed animals, action figures, video games, and so much more. 
							Whether it is purely for fun or will be used as a teaching tool, you can find it here at T3.

							<h3>About the Company</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							Here at T3, we beleive that all children should have the same opportuinities to find toys that they will enjoy and play with for years to come.
							We test products from all of our manufacturers before we stock them on our shelves to ensure that your child will be getting only the safest and most durable toys available.
							We have at least one of every toy in stock available to try and see for yourself.
							Kids are always welcome in our store and we encourage you to let them look around our "Try It Out" area to see if the toy they want is something they will actually like.
							We are about the happiness of children at T3 rather than just looking to make money.

							<h3>About Trinity</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							Trinity Troublemaker is the current owner of T3. The store has been handed down through the family for generations. 
							At the age of 10, she was given the store to run and is currently working on expanding the store's presence to allow for online shopping.
							At 12 years old, she has an understanding of what kids her age like and what the "hot new thing" is. While she is technically the owner, the major business decisions are mostly left to the adults.
							This leaves Trinity time to play with the toys and see if it might be something we want to sell at T3.
