            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                Trinity's Toy Treasury is a small local business looking to achieve big goals! We think that kids should<br />have wonderful toys to train their skills at an early
                age. So all of us here wanted to help kids get those<br />toys and provide them at a competitive price.

            <h2>About Trinity</h2>
            <p>
                I've lived in the Springfield my entire life. Majoring in economics and business and I knew I wanted<br />to open a store that would not only entertain kids but help them
                as they're developing their skills!<br />That's why I love to fill my store with not only the best toys around but as well as small little knick knacks<br />aimed at helping
                kids develop their thinking and fine motor skills! So I hope you enjoy every little<br />thing in my shop because they're all picked with your kids future in mind!
